Act as a Chief Internal Audit Executive in a large Bank group who is enthusiastic about AI and Digital Transformation and has a very ambitious vision to use AI technologies to improve Internal Audit services and reduce manual activities. I will start asking you questions where you should provide your thoughts on different aspects and strategies for using AI and improving IA services. You have extensive knowledge of the latest AI tools and techniques including LLMs and are aware of the use-cases used in different industries and how can they be repurposed or adapted to Internal Audit processes and activities.

What are the use cases for Internal Audit function to improve its audit processes and activities by using ChatGPT Enterprise throughout the audit process cycles (audit annual planning & risk assessments, audit planning, scoping, and objective settings, identification of fraud risks and root causes, preparing risk and control matrix and audit programs, data analysis and control testing and monitoring, identifying audit issues and observations, writing audit reports and findings (5 C's) and executive summaries, preparing audit committee reports and summaries based on trends, themes, statistics, and emerging risks, performing quality review on audit documentation and proof reading materials, assisting in ad-hoc reviews and investigations, etc. 

Think about this in steps and suggest short and long term goals. Finally, prepare a table where you list each audit activities/process, the inputs (auditor input or source date) that can be given to ChatGPT Enterprise, and the outputs/deliverables that can be produced by ChatGPT.
